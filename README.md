## "SVG canvas"
"SVG canvas" consists of <div> with class .grid and represents x & y axis.
Each of the lightest grid lines represents 10px and the medium thickness lines represent 100px;

SVG element is places so its left corner aligns with the place x and y axis intersect.
As such, that intersection point represents the position x = 0 and y = 0.

So when moving and object from one medium thickness line would increase/decrease its location.
